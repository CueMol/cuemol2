[CueMol](http://www.cuemol.org/) - Molecular Visualization Framework
====================================================================

**CueMol** is a computer program for the macromolecular structure visualization
(CueMol was formerly called "Que").
CueMol aims to visualize the crystallographic models of macromolecules with the user-friendly interfaces.
Currently supported files are molecular coordinates (PDB format),
electron density (CCP4, CNS , and MTZ formats),
MSMS surface data, and APBS electrostatic potential map.

Powered by [Mozilla XULRunner](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla-based.html),
the application framework of Firefox and Thunderbird (and other mozilla-based application as well),
CueMol2 now runs under both Windows, MacOS X, and Linux in a similar GUI appearance.
